# c-hive.dev

A website to showcase ourselves: https://c-hive.gitlab.io/c-hive.dev/

## MVP proposal

SPA using one of the popular frameworks (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js) or using an existing template (e.g. wordpress) with our own additions.

## Constraint

The entire application has been built built so that the first user within the list determines the fundamental appearance of the calendar. The reason for this behavior is that GitHub provides two ways of viewing the last year contributions under **Contributions settings**. As a result, the first user should be in possession of a calendar in which the **Activity overview** isn't selected. Either way, an error is thrown and the remaining queries are aborted.
